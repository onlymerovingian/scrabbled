# scrabbled
A python project to help distressed dyslexic engineers play scrabble.

This project was created to help me:

a) Beat my competitive scrabble obsessed father at scrabble

b) Re-fresh my Python skills

c) Learn how to use Git Hub

The algorithms used in finding word matches are horribly inefficient and do not work to a level at which I am happy with yet.
